# Rust Email Service 🦀

This repository houses the implementation of a **Cloud-Native API** built with **Rust**, following the principles of "Zero To Production In Rust".

The project serves as a reference implementation for building production-grade backend systems, moving beyond syntax basics to tackle real-world engineering challenges.

## 🏗 Architectural Goals

The primary focus is to architect a system that is robust, scalable, and maintainable in a cloud environment.

- **Cloud-Native & Fault-Tolerant:** Designed to handle dynamic workloads and survive infrastructure failures without downtime.
- **Reliability First:** Leveraging Rust's ownership model and type system to ensure memory safety and correctness "from the get-go".
- **Observability:** Instrumented with structured logging, tracing, and metrics to ensure the system is opaque-free during operation.
- **CI/CD & TDD:** A strong emphasis on automated testing (Test-Driven Development) and Continuous Integration pipelines to guarantee code quality on every commit.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Rust (Stable)
- **Web Framework:** Actix-web
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure:** Docker & Kubernetes

## 🚀 Getting Started
